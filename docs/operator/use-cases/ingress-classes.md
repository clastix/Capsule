# Assign Ingress Classes
An Ingress Controller is used in Kubernetes to publish services and applications outside of the cluster. An Ingress Controller can be provisioned to accept only Ingresses with a given Ingress Class.

Bill can assign a set of dedicated Ingress Classes to the `oil` tenant to force the applications in the `oil` tenant to be published only by the assigned Ingress Controller: 

```yaml
apiVersion: capsule.clastix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: oil
spec:
  owner:
    name: alice
    kind: User
  ingressClasses:
     allowed:
     - oil
  ...
```

It is also possible to use regular expression for assigning Ingress Classes:

```yaml
apiVersion: capsule.clastix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: oil
spec:
  owner:
    name: alice
    kind: User
  ingressClasses:
     allowedRegex: "^oil-.*$"
  ...
```

The Capsule controller assures that all Ingresses created in the tenant can use only one of the valid Ingress Classes. Alice, as tenant owner, gets the list of valid Ingress Classes by checking any of her namespaces:

```
alice@caas# kubectl describe ns oil-production
Name:         oil-production
Labels:       capsule.clastix.io/tenant=oil
Annotations:  capsule.clastix.io/ingress-classes: oil
              capsule.clastix.io/ingress-classes-regexp: ^oil-.*$
...
```

Alice creates an Ingress using a valid Ingress Class in the annotation:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: oil-production
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: oil
spec:
  rules:
  - host: web.oil-inc.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: nginx
          servicePort: 80
        path: /
```

Any attempt of Alice to use a non valid Ingress Class, e.g. `default`, will fail.

> The effect of this policy is that the services created in the tenant will be published
> only on the Ingress Controller designated by Bill to accept one of the allowed Ingress Classes.
