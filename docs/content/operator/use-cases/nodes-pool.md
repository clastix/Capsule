# Assign a node's pool
Bill, the cluster admin, can dedicate a pool of worker nodes to the `oil` tenant, to isolate the tenant applications from other noisy neighbors.

These nodes are labeled by Bill as `pool=oil`

```
kubectl get nodes --show-labels

NAME                      STATUS   ROLES             AGE   VERSION   LABELS
...
worker06.acme.com         Ready    worker            8d    v1.18.2   pool=oil
worker07.acme.com         Ready    worker            8d    v1.18.2   pool=oil
worker08.acme.com         Ready    worker            8d    v1.18.2   pool=oil
```

The label `pool=oil` is defined as node selector in the tenant manifest:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: capsule.clastix.io/v1beta1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: oil
spec:
  owners:
  - name: alice
    kind: User
  nodeSelector:
    pool: oil
    kubernetes.io/os: linux
EOF
```

The Capsule controller makes sure that any namespace created in the tenant has the annotation: `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/node-selector: pool=oil`. This annotation tells the scheduler of Kubernetes to assign the node selector `pool=oil` to all the pods deployed in the tenant. The effect is that all the pods deployed by Alice are placed only on the designated pool of nodes.

Multiple node selector labels can be defined as in the following snippet:

```yaml
apiVersion: capsule.clastix.io/v1beta1
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: oil
spec:
  owners:
  - name: alice
    kind: User
  nodeSelector:
    pool: oil
    kubernetes.io/os: linux
    kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    hardware: gpu
```

Any attempt of Alice to change the selector on the pods will result in an error from the `PodNodeSelector` Admission Controller plugin.

Also, RBAC prevents Alice to change the annotation on the namespace:

```
kubectl auth can-i edit ns -n oil-production
no
```
